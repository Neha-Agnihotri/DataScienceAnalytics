1. Diabetes Risk Prediction (Python)

This project's main goal was to thoroughly assess and choose the best machine learning model for predicting diabetes. This project is significant because it has the potential to improve early intervention and preventive strategies for people who are at risk of acquiring diabetes. The urgent global health issue presented by diabetes served as the driving force for the selection of this specific topic and dataset. Accurate and prompt identification of those at risk becomes crucial due to its rising prevalence and significant impact on public health.

2. Superstore Sales Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL to derive valuable insights. Key metrics include total sales, profit margins, and customer segmentation. The project involves writing complex SQL queries to track product performance, identify top-selling regions, and uncover sales trends over time. By leveraging SQL, the analysis provides a foundation for data-driven decision-making to optimize business strategies.

3. Web Scraping (Python)

The primary aim of this project is to leverage web scraping techniques to extract valuable data from the Yellow Pages website. This dataset will serve as a starting point for future research projects. It includes a complete list of restaurants in a specific place, including key insights such as restaurant names, contact information, precise addresses, customer ratings, and a variety of other relevant information.

4. Supply Chain Anaysis Dashboard (Power BI)

The dataset used in this Power BI project is from Kaggle, titled "DataCo Smart Supply Chain for Big Data Analysis." It includes comprehensive information on various aspects of supply chain management such as sales, customer details, product categories, shipping details, and more. This dataset is crucial for analyzing and optimizing supply chain processes, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, demand planning, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and customer insights.
